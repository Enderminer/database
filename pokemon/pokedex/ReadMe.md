# Pokedex Database
You can use this folder to help us update our Pokedex Database.

Please try to go off the official [Pokemon Website's Pokedex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/) when getting your information.

Once you've submitted an update to the file we will review it and if approved it will be added.

# Why are you allowing Community Contributions?
The database is hard to update with just a few people so we've opened it up to everyone.

# Is this licensed by Nintendo?
We wish, Nintendo generally doesn't allow community creations like this.

We are also not licensed, endorsed, or supported by Nintendo at all.
